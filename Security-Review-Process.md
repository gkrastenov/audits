# Security Review Process

## Questions to the Project

1. What's the clear scope of smart contracts - nSLOC?
2. Does the project have well-written specifications & code documentation?
3. What is the code test coverage percentage?
4. Have you had any audits so far?

Based on the answers to the above questions, we can discuss the payment amount and deadline.

## Vulnerability Fixes Review

After the agreed-upon time has passed, the project will receive the security review report. The project has up to 14 days to apply fixes to issues found. A single iteration of a "fixes review" will be executed by me, free of additional charges, to verify that your fixes are correct and the code is secure.

### Important Notes for the Fixes Review

- For any questions or clarifications on the vulnerabilities/recommendations in the report, you can reach out to me on the intended communication channel.
- Changes to be reviewed should only include fixes for the reported issues. No major refactorings, new features, or architectural changes should be included.
- In the case that fixes are too difficult to implement or more than one iteration of reviews is needed, then this is a special case that can be discussed independently of this review.

## Other Questions

1. What is your preferred communication channel (Discord, Twitter, Telegram)?
2. Are you okay with me publishing the security review report after you apply fixes?
